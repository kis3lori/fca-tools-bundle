            Once you've generated the concepts of a context the most common way of visualizing them is in a concept
            lattice.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this you first have to generate it by clicking the "Generate Concept Lattice" button. <br/>
            After the concept lattice was generated you can view it by clicking the "View Concept Lattice" button that
            will appear besides the previous one.
        </p>

        <p>
            The concept lattice viewer uses a force-layout to automatically arrange the nodes in the graph. <br/>
            This method produces a pretty good diagram from the very start which you can then further improve by
            dragging the nodes manually.
