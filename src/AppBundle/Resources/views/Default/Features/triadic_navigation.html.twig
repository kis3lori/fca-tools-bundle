<p>
    One common problem with triadic contexts is that it is hard to analyze them. <br/>
    This is because once you generate the concepts you cannot view them in a concept lattice like in the case of a
    dyadic context.
</p>

<p>
    In order to solve this issue, analyzing triadic contexts is done by deriving dyadic contexts from them and
    analyzing the concept lattices of the simpler contexts. <br/>
    The derivation of dyadic contexts is done by projecting along one of the dimensions of a triadic concept,
    that is: the extent, the intent or the modus. <br/>
    The component along which the projection is done is called the
    perspective.
</p>

<p>
    First a concept of the triadic concept is chosen. <br/>
    After that, the projected dyadic context is built along
    one of the perspectives of the triadic concept and its concept lattice is computed. <br/>
    It can be proved that
    every dyadic concept of this projected context corresponds to exactly one tri-concept in the original
    tri-lattice. <br/>
    These tri-concepts are called directly reachable and navigation among them is performed in the underlying
    dyadic concept lattice. <br/>
    The navigation is done by selecting one of the dyadic concepts of the dyadic context and computing the
    associated triadic concept. <br/>
    By choosing different perspectives of that triadic concept one can navigate through the triadic context
    obtaining a different dyadic concept lattice and so on.

<p><strong>Step by Step Example</strong></p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-5">
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong> <br/>
            In order to start analysing the context you first go to the list of concepts and select a starting point
            for your navigation. <br/>
            Then you lock in on one of the dimensions of the concept by clicking the "Lock" button. <br/>
            This will generate a dyadic context and show you its concept lattice.

             alt="concept selection"/>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2</strong> <br/>
            Once you have the dyadic concept lattice you can right-click one of the concepts in order to view the
            triadic concept associated with it. <br/>
            This way you can view information regarding the triadic context through the underlying dyadic context.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ asset("bundles/app/images/features/triadic_context/triadic_context_navigation.png") }}"
             alt="triadic context navigation"/>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong> <br/>
    After right-clicking a concept you can select a different dimension of that triadic concept and change the
    perspective by locking in on that one. <br/>
    This will generate a new dyadic context with its own concept lattice.
</p>

<p>
    By repeating this process you can analyze the triadic context.

    The above navigation works even if the context is too big to generate all its concepts. <br/>
    The only difference is that in the first step you have to find a concept using the <strong>Concept Finder</strong>.
